//QUESTIONS
    1. I don't know if I did this correctly, but from my understanding, this was the best I could come up with.
    2. To clarify, When the new data is submitted, the data is added to the JSON and then rendered to the browser. 
    3. Does SPA store and render the inputted data as none-SPA?
